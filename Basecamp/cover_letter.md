## Longevity < Reputation < Respect < Understanding

Longevity is derived from reputation, which is derived from respect, which is derived from understanding.

**This is what I think of when I think of Basecamp.**

Understanding and empathy, closely related concepts, appear to be a big part of what makes Basecamp what it is. And let me tell you, I think that's great. Basecamp isn't focused on 10x growth this quarter, or expanding into a new market, or any other ridiculous metric that SV fancies this season. *Basecamp focuses on the things that matter to people.* This is how it has been able to remain in business going on 17 years.

This doesn't just apply to customers. This applies to everyone, most notably, their employees. I've seen [the blog post][1], and it's incredible. I keep a copy on my desktop. But it's not about the money. It's about the empathy. Everything that I've read about Basecamp suggests their employees love working there. In a world where 18 months is a long time, Basecamp has something that makes employees stick around a while. What does Basecamp have? Understanding. Respect. Reputation. Longevity.

## Projects I'm Interested In (No particular order):

Here are the 3 most interesting projects listed on the internship announcement post.
I chose these because they provide opportunities to *connect with people*.

* **Programming:** Research and implement new features for Trix, our open-source rich text editor (JavaScript / CoffeeScript) and integrate those features in Basecamp 3.

* **Programming:** Change the way people find information internally at Basecamp by unifying various internal search tools into a single source of all the information people need to respond to customer problems. You'll talk to internal clients, survey the state of the world, and then build out a solution.

* **Design:** Understand how people work with clients in Basecamp through a mix of quantitative analysis and customer research (surveys, structured interviews). You'll work to structure the problem, identify the data that you need, write survey questions and interview guides, conduct interviews, and synthesize findings and implications for client features within Basecamp.


## Projects

Most of the projects I've completed so far have been assignments from my mentorship at Bloc.io. But, I'm also working my way through Seven Languages In Seven Weeks, and The Well-Grounded Rubyist. I plan on posting all of the assignments and exercises to my github account. And of course, any projects I work on at DevBootcamp will be there too.

**Curent Projects:**
  * [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks][seven]
  * Well-Grounded Rubyist
  * DevBootcamp

**Past Projects**
  * [Blocmarks][blocmarks]
  * [Blocmetrics][blocmetrics]
  * [Blocmetrics client][blocmetrics-client]
  * [Blocipedia][blocipedia]
  * [Bloccit][bloccit]
  * [Open-Todo API][todo]

**Games**
  * [Battleship-Python][bs-python]
  * Battleship-Ruby (coming soon)

## Why Me?

**Don't be friction. Be lubricant**

I like [NVC][nvc]. I want to bring it everywhere I go. I hope to go everywhere. I'd like to start with Basecamp.

Why NVC? Non-Violent Communication is a communication framework typically reserved for conflict resolution. But I thought, if it works well in conflict, just imagine how well it'll work in normal life. So now I use it all the time. And I was right. It's great. I believe Basecamp probably uses some of the techniques and strategies of NVC, which is why they are so successful with clients and employees.

If conflict is friction, then NVC is lubrication. Practicing NVC is like adding lubrication to your engine. It just makes everything run smoother. In a world where individual accomplishments are amplified by teams, interacting with people is a necessity. This makes effective communication even more mission critical.

Imagine a 10x programmer, if such thing exists. Let's say they add just a little bit of friction with everyone they interact with. In the past, this programmer may have been able to get by without interacting with anyone. Not so much anymore. Today they might interact with a significant portion of the entire company, either directly or indirectly. That little bit of friction starts to add up, and now that '10x' title might not be so deserving.

After DevBootcamp and before the summer, I'll have just shy of 9 months of directed learning, and just about the same in self-directed learning. As David said himself, 6 months is really all you need to get started with anything. I'm going to bring the knowledge and skills I've learned related to web development. And I'm going to bring the knowledge and skills I've learned related to communication. And I'm going to be effective, and I'm going to be lubrication. (ok, that sounded a little weird, but I think you get the point)

Let me participate in your process of creating *meaningful* things. Let me help you and your team make connections with your clients, and also with each other.

## Availability

I'm available as soon as I wrap up DevBootcamp on May 6th. :checkered_flag:
I'm living in San Diego CA, but that's flexible.
